Video search made with React
====================

This project was made in order to learn React. First I made this using class components and lifecycle methods. I then converted it to use hooks, functional componenants and custom hooks. 
I focused mostly on learning React and only added a little bit of CSS to create a desktop layout. This is a quick and dirty project but helped me understand a lot of the basics of Reacts. 

This application utilizes youtubes API, it is limited to 50 requests an hour. If you suddlent see nothing showing up check the console logs and you are likely to see a 403 error due to hitting that request limit.
